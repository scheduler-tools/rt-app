==============
 REQUIREMENTS
==============

rt-app runs on GNU/Linux. It needs autoconf, automake, libtool , libjson-c and
a recent compiler (mainly: gcc) for basic features.

=============
 COMPILATION
=============

$ autoreconf --install
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

Last step is optional, rt-app is built in the src/ directory.

Typical usage:

$ ./configure --prefix=<directory>
	installs the compiled program in the given directory

$ ./configure --with-deadline
	builds rt-app with support for SCHED_DEADLINE

See ./configure --help for additional options.

For cross-compilation, you may have to set the CC environment variable to your
cross-compiler, and provide the --host option (e.g., --host=arm).
